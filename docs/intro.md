# Tutorial Intro

In modern microservices architecture, **event-driven communication** is becoming a powerful paradigm. Instead of services calling each other directly (tight coupling), they **react to events**, enabling better **scalability, fault-tolerance, and flexibility**.

There are many tools available to implement event-driven systems â€” each with its own strengths:

- **Kafka**: High-throughput, persistent log, ideal for large-scale data pipelines.
- **RabbitMQ**: Reliable message broker with routing capabilities.
- **Redis Streams**: Lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use option for event streaming.
- And others like **NATS**, **AWS SNS/SQS**, **Azure Event Hubs**, etc.

> ðŸš€ In this tutorial, I'll focus on **Redis Streams**, using what I've learned from **Redis University** and **Spring Data Redis**, to help you build event-driven microservices quickly and efficiently.

## âœ¨ Why Redis Streams?

Redis is already widely adopted for caching and in-memory storage, but Redis Streams (available since Redis 5.0) brings **powerful append-only log capabilities** to the table â€” making it suitable for event sourcing and real-time processing in microservices.

### ðŸ”¥ Features:
- Append-only event log
- Persistent storage
- Blocking reads (real-time)
- Consumer groups (parallel processing, tracking)
- Lightweight, easy to operate

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

This hands-on tutorial aims to **accelerate your event-driven journey** using Redis Streams + Spring Boot:

- Core concepts of Redis Streams (`XADD`, `XREAD`, `XREADGROUP`, `XACK`)
- Stream setup and CLI testing
- Producer/consumer pattern in Spring Data Redis
- How to backfill and stream live data
- Consumer Groups for horizontal scalability
- Real-world use cases and best practices

---

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites

Before diving in, it helps to be familiar with:

- Basic Redis CLI commands
- Spring Boot fundamentals
- Java and Maven/Gradle build tools
- Microservice architecture basics (REST, services, etc.)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

This guide is perfect for:

- Developers who are new to Redis Streams
- Spring Boot engineers building microservices
- Anyone looking for a **lightweight** alternative to Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Teams who already use Redis and want to unlock more value from it

---

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

> Don't let complex tooling slow you down. Start with something lightweight like Redis Streams to grasp the **core principles of event-driven systems** â€” then scale up to Kafka or other tools when needed.

Letâ€™s dive in and start with the basics of Redis Streams in the next section!
